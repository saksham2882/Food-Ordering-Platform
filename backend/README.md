# Food Delivery Platform - Backend

## üöÄ Project Overview

This is the backend for a **real-time food delivery platform**. It is a complete, full-featured backend system built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. The platform connects users, restaurants (shops), and delivery personnel in real-time. It is designed to be scalable, efficient, and easy to maintain.

## üéØ Project Aim

The main goal of this project is to provide a robust and reliable backend for a food delivery service. This includes:

-   User authentication and authorization.
-   Management of restaurants (shops) and their menus (items).
-   Real-time order processing and tracking.
-   Real-time location tracking of delivery personnel.
-   A complete delivery assignment system.
-   Online payment processing.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

| Technology | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Node.js** | A JavaScript runtime environment that allows for the execution of JavaScript code on the server-side. It is known for its speed and efficiency. |
| **Express.js** | A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. |
| **MongoDB** | A NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents. It is known for its scalability and performance. |
| **Socket.IO** | A library that enables real-time, bidirectional, and event-based communication between web clients and servers. |
| **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** | A compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. It is used for authentication and authorization. |
| **Cloudinary** | A cloud-based image and video management service. It is used to store and serve all the images for the platform. |
| **Razorpay** | A payment gateway that allows for online payment processing. |

## üèóÔ∏è Project Architecture

The project follows a layered architecture pattern, which is a variation of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. This architecture separates the application into three logical layers:

1.  **Presentation Layer (Routes)**: This layer is responsible for handling all incoming HTTP requests and sending responses back to the client. It is implemented using Express.js routes. The routes are defined in the `routes` directory.

2.  **Business Logic Layer (Controllers)**: This layer contains the core business logic of the application. It is responsible for processing the requests from the Presentation Layer, interacting with the Data Access Layer, and preparing the data for the response. The controllers are located in the `controllers` directory.

3.  **Data Access Layer (Models)**: This layer is responsible for all interactions with the database. It uses Mongoose models to define the schema for the data and to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the database. The models are defined in the `models` directory.
